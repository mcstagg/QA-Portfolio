# Exploratory Test Notes

**Timebox:** 30 min

- 00:00: Loaded login page. Form is centered and accessible.
- 02:15: Tried logging in with invalid email — error appears, but not highlighted clearly.
- 04:30: Valid credentials → clicked Login → nothing happened. Tried again — login worked.
- 07:00: Observed that login requires 2 clicks — BUG.
- 12:00: Password field doesn't toggle visibility — minor UX note.
- 15:00: Attempted input with script tag `<script>` — no sanitization message.
- 25:00: Tried keyboard-only nav — works well.
