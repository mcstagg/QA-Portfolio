# 03 Exploratory Testing

This folder documents a 30-minute exploratory test session focused on the login form of a sample React app. I discovered a reproducible bug (login works only on 2nd click), UX feedback issues, and an input sanitization concern. Artifacts include my session charter, notes, and bug summaries.
