# 05 Regression Testing

This module documents a regression testing session conducted after a code update to a login component. The goal was to verify that new changes did not break existing functionality.

## 🔁 What Was Tested
- Login flow
- Error messaging
- Dashboard redirect
- Token generation

## 🔍 Approach
- Compared behavior before and after changes
- Verified existing test cases still passed
- Logged any regressions and their fixes

Artifacts include a test plan, test case spreadsheet, screenshots, and result summary.
